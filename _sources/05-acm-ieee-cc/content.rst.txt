ACM/IEEE (and other)Curricular Standards
==========================================

The Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) is a leading international organization for computing professionals, and they periodically release guidelines for computing curricula to help educational institutions design their programs.

The ACM curriculum guidelines cover various aspects of computing education, including computer science, information systems, information technology, software engineering, and cybersecurity. These guidelines aim to provide a framework for colleges and universities to develop comprehensive, relevant, and up-to-date computing programs.

Here are some key components of the ACM computing curriculum:

- Core knowledge areas: The curriculum is divided into several knowledge areas, such as algorithms and complexity, programming languages, software development fundamentals, systems, and computer organization and architecture.

- Elective knowledge areas: In addition to the core knowledge areas, the ACM curriculum also offers elective areas to allow students to specialize in specific topics, such as artificial intelligence, human-computer interaction, and data science.

- Skill development: The curriculum emphasizes the development of skills such as problem-solving, critical thinking, communication, and teamwork.

- Ethical considerations: The ACM curriculum incorporates ethical considerations in computing, such as understanding the social impact of technology, privacy issues, and professional responsibility.

- Project-based learning: The curriculum encourages hands-on, project-based learning to help students apply their knowledge in real-world situations.

- Continuous improvement: The ACM regularly updates its curriculum guidelines to keep up with the rapidly evolving field of computing.

What data structures are typically needed in a B.S. in Bioinformatics degree?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Bioinformatics often deals with large and complex biological data sets, and understanding the right data structures can be crucial for processing this data efficiently. Here are some data structures commonly used in bioinformatics:

1. **Arrays and Lists**: These are fundamental data structures in any programming language, used for storing and manipulating collections of elements. In bioinformatics, they can be used to store sequences of nucleotides or amino acids.

2. **Strings**: Strings are essential for representing and manipulating biological sequences such as DNA, RNA, and protein sequences.

3. **Hash Tables (Dictionaries)**: These are used to store and retrieve data in constant time. They can be used for tasks such as counting the frequency of specific nucleotide sequences in a DNA string or mapping genes to their associated information.

4. **Trees**: Particularly, Binary Trees and Balanced Search Trees are used in various bioinformatics algorithms. Phylogenetic trees, which represent the evolutionary relationships among various biological species, are one example.

5. **Graphs**: Graphs are used to model various biological phenomena. For example, protein-protein interaction networks, gene regulatory networks, and metabolic pathways can all be represented as graphs. In sequence assembly, De Bruijn graphs are a commonly used data structure.

6. **Priority Queues/Heaps**: Used in many algorithms, including those for genome assembly and sequence alignment.
