Motivation
-------------

This is an effort to map our curriculum at Loyola University Chicago to the established international guidelines (ACM and IEEE).
We are motivated by the following research questions:

- How do our degree requirements for CS, SE, IT, and Cybersecurity majors map to the ACM/IEEE Computing Curricula (and other) guidelines? 
- What are the actual learning outcomes in our *foundation sequence* courses?
- Can generative AI large language/coding models help us to *improve* teaching of theoretical and practical (programming) topics?
- Can we provide more historical/cultural context to CS students (also with the help of generative AI)?
