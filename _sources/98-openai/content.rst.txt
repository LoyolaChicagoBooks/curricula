When was the first computer science program created?
-------------------------------------------------------

The first computer science program can be traced back to 1962, when Purdue University established the first Department of Computer Science in the United States. At that time, computer science was a relatively new field, and many universities had only offered computer-related courses as part of their mathematics or engineering programs.

As interest in computer science grew, more universities began to create dedicated computer science programs. By the late 1960s and early 1970s, many universities around the world had established computer science departments and degree programs. The development of these programs was further supported by organizations like the ACM and the IEEE Computer Society, which provided curriculum recommendations and guidelines to help standardize computer science education.

When were the first curricular guidelines for computer science degrees established?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The first curricular guidelines for computer science degrees were published in 1968 by the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM). The report, titled "Curriculum 68: Recommendations for Academic Programs in Computer Science," provided a framework for institutions to develop undergraduate computer science programs.

"Curriculum 68" aimed to define the core components of a computer science education and offer guidance on organizing courses and content. It was a landmark document that helped shape the early development of computer science as an academic discipline. Since then, the ACM has periodically updated its curriculum recommendations to keep pace with the rapidly evolving field of computer science.

Is there a URL for this that is on ACM and not on some random site?
---------------------------------------------------------------------

The original "Curriculum 68" report is not directly available on the ACM website. As it is an older document, it might not be readily accessible in digital format on the ACM's official site.

However, you can find a historical overview and analysis of the "Curriculum 68" and other early curricular guidelines in an article published by the ACM titled "The History of Computing Curricula 1965-2009" by Eric Roberts. This article provides valuable insights into the development of computer science curricula over the years.

Which of the curricla reference CS1 and CS2. Is this terminology still relevant?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CS1 and CS2 terminology originated from the early ACM curricular guidelines and has been used in subsequent versions to some extent. The terms refer to the foundational sequence of computer science courses, where CS1 is an introductory course in programming, and CS2 is a course that focuses on data structures and more advanced programming concepts. Here's a brief overview of the curricular guidelines that mention CS1 and CS2:

- Curriculum 68 (1968): Does not specifically use the terms CS1 and CS2.
- Curriculum 78 (1978): Refers to the terms CS1 and CS2.
- Computing Curricula 1991 (CC1991): Uses the terms CS1 and CS2.
- Computing Curricula 2001 (CC2001): Refers to CS1 and CS2 in the context of introductory courses, but with less emphasis.
- Computing Curricula 2005 (CC2005): Does not explicitly use the terms CS1 and CS2.
- Computer Science Curricula 2013 (CS2013): Refers to CS1 and CS2 in the context of introductory courses, but with less emphasis.
- Computing Curricula 2020 (CC2020): Does not explicitly use the terms CS1 and CS2.

While the terminology of CS1 and CS2 might not be explicitly mentioned in the most recent curricular guidelines (CC2020), the concepts behind them are still relevant. The CC2020 guidelines provide learning outcomes and topics for introductory programming courses (similar to CS1 and CS2) under the "Algorithms and Complexity" and "Programming Languages" knowledge areas.

In summary, the terms CS1 and CS2 might not be explicitly used in the latest ACM/IEEE curricular guidelines, but the concepts behind these foundational computer science courses remain relevant and are covered within the broader framework of the guidelines.

What are the most common 1st, 2nd, and 3rd year courses in computer science?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The most common computer science courses in the first, second, and third years of an undergraduate program may vary between institutions, but there are some core subjects that are typically covered during these years. Here's a general list of common courses for each year:

How much math is absolutely required for a CS degree, focusing on the ACM guidelines?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

According to the ACM/IEEE Computing Curricula 2020 (CC2020) guidelines, mathematics plays an essential role in computer science education. While the exact requirements may vary among institutions, the guidelines recommend several key areas of mathematics that are important for computer science students. These areas include:

- *Discrete Mathematics*: This is a crucial part of computer science and typically covers topics such as set theory, logic, relations, functions, combinatorics, graph theory, and proofs.
- *Probability and Statistics*: These topics are important for analyzing algorithms, understanding data science, and working with machine learning. Students should learn basic probability theory, random variables, distributions, hypothesis testing, and regression analysis.
- *Linear Algebra*: This area of mathematics is essential for computer graphics, machine learning, and data science. It covers topics such as vectors, matrices, linear transformations, and eigenvalues.
- *Calculus*: Although not every computer science student may need advanced calculus, a basic understanding of differential and integral calculus is often required. Calculus is particularly important in areas such as optimization, numerical analysis, and some aspects of machine learning.
- *Numerical Methods*: These techniques are used to solve mathematical problems that cannot be solved analytically. They are relevant to computer graphics, scientific computing, and some machine learning applications.

The exact courses and extent of mathematical knowledge required for a computer science degree may vary depending on the institution and the specific program. However, the above topics represent the core mathematical areas that the ACM/IEEE curricular guidelines recommend for a well-rounded computer science education.

Are these same math classes always needed for other ACM/IEEE curricula, e.g. SE and IT?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The ACM/IEEE curricular guidelines for other computing disciplines, such as Software Engineering (SE) and Information Technology (IT), have some overlap with the mathematics requirements for a computer science degree, but they may also have differences based on the focus of each discipline.

For Software Engineering (SE), the mathematical requirements are likely to be similar to those for a computer science degree. The ACM/IEEE Software Engineering 2004 (SE2004) guidelines recommend the following mathematical topics:

- Discrete Mathematics
- Probability and Statistics
- Calculus
- Linear Algebra
- Numerical Methods

For Information Technology (IT), the mathematical requirements may be less extensive than those for computer science or software engineering. According to the ACM/IEEE Information Technology 2017 (IT2017) guidelines, IT students should have a solid foundation in the following mathematical areas:

- Discrete Mathematics
- Probability and Statistics
- College Algebra or Pre-Calculus

Although the exact requirements may vary depending on the institution and the specific program, these recommendations provide a general idea of the mathematical areas relevant to each discipline. It's important to note that the mathematical requirements for IT may be less extensive than those for CS or SE, as IT programs often focus more on applied skills and practical aspects of computing.

How about Cybersecurity? 
--------------------------

For Cybersecurity, the mathematical requirements may not be as extensive as those for a computer science degree. However, having a strong foundation in certain mathematical areas is crucial for understanding and applying cybersecurity concepts. The Joint Task Force on Cybersecurity Education, formed by ACM, IEEE-CS, AIS, and IFIP, released the Cybersecurity Curricular Guidelines in 2017 (CSEC2017). According to the CSEC2017 guidelines, cybersecurity students should have a solid foundation in the following mathematical areas:

- *Discrete Mathematics*: As with other computing disciplines, discrete mathematics is essential for understanding fundamental concepts such as logic, set theory, relations, functions, combinatorics, graph theory, and proofs.
- *Probability and Statistics*: This area is important for risk assessment, anomaly detection, and understanding the performance of security systems. Students should learn basic probability theory, random variables, distributions, hypothesis testing, and regression analysis.
- *Basic Algebra, Number Theory, and Finite Fields*: These topics are particularly relevant for cryptography, which is a crucial aspect of cybersecurity. Students should understand concepts such as modular arithmetic, prime numbers, and finite fields.
- *Calculus*: A basic understanding of differential and integral calculus may be useful in some areas of cybersecurity, such as optimization and analysis of algorithms. However, the emphasis on calculus in a cybersecurity program might not be as strong as in a computer science program.

While the exact courses and extent of mathematical knowledge required for a cybersecurity degree may vary depending on the institution and the specific program, the above topics represent the core mathematical areas that the CSEC2017 curricular guidelines recommend for a well-rounded cybersecurity education.
