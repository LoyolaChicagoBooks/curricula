Background
=============

When was the first computer science program created?
-------------------------------------------------------

The first computer science program can be traced back to 1962, when Purdue University established the first Department of Computer Science in the United States. At that time, computer science was a relatively new field, and many universities had only offered computer-related courses as part of their mathematics or engineering programs.

As interest in computer science grew, more universities began to create dedicated computer science programs. By the late 1960s and early 1970s, many universities around the world had established computer science departments and degree programs. The development of these programs was further supported by organizations like the ACM and the IEEE Computer Society, which provided curriculum recommendations and guidelines to help standardize computer science education.

When were the first curricular guidelines for computer science degrees established?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The first curricular guidelines for computer science degrees were published in 1968 by the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM). The report, titled "Curriculum 68: Recommendations for Academic Programs in Computer Science," provided a framework for institutions to develop undergraduate computer science programs.

"Curriculum 68" aimed to define the core components of a computer science education and offer guidance on organizing courses and content. It was a landmark document that helped shape the early development of computer science as an academic discipline. Since then, the ACM has periodically updated its curriculum recommendations to keep pace with the rapidly evolving field of computer science.

Is there a URL for this that is on ACM and not on some random site?
---------------------------------------------------------------------

The original "Curriculum 68" report is not directly available on the ACM website. As it is an older document, it might not be readily accessible in digital format on the ACM's official site.

However, you can find a historical overview and analysis of the "Curriculum 68" and other early curricular guidelines in an article published by the ACM titled "The History of Computing Curricula 1965-2009" by Eric Roberts. This article provides valuable insights into the development of computer science curricula over the years.

Great, can you give me a list of all versions of ACM and IEEE computing curricular guidelines?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The ACM and IEEE Computer Society have been collaborating on computing curricula guidelines for several decades. Here is a list of the major versions of the ACM and IEEE computing curricular guidelines:

Curriculum 68: Recommendations for Academic Programs in Computer Science (1968)

- Developed by ACM
- URL: http://bitsavers.trailing-edge.com/pdf/acm/Curriculum68.pdf

Curriculum 78: Recommendations for the Undergraduate Program in Computer Science (1978)

- Developed by ACM and IEEE-CS (IEEE Computer Society)
- URL: https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/education/curricula-recommendations/cc1978.pdf

Computing Curricula 1991 (CC1991)

- Developed by ACM and IEEE-CS
- URL: https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/education/curricula-recommendations/cc1991.pdf

Computing Curricula 2001 (CC2001)

- Developed by ACM and IEEE-CS
- URL: https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/education/curricula-recommendations/cc2001.pdf

Computing Curricula 2005: The Overview Report (CC2005)

- Developed by ACM, IEEE-CS, AIS (Association for Information Systems), and IFIP (International Federation for Information Processing)
- URL: https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/education/curricula-recommendations/cc2005-march06final.pdf

Computer Science Curricula 2013 (CS2013)

- Developed by ACM and IEEE-CS
- URL: https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/education/cs2013_web_final.pdf

Computing Curricula 2020 (CC2020)

- Developed by ACM and IEEE-CS
- URL: https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/education/cc2020-final-report.pdf

Note that these guidelines have evolved over time to keep up with the rapid developments in computing and technology. The most recent version, CC2020, provides a comprehensive and up-to-date framework for computer science and related computing disciplines.

Which of the curricla reference CS1 and CS2. Is this terminology still relevant?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CS1 and CS2 terminology originated from the early ACM curricular guidelines and has been used in subsequent versions to some extent. The terms refer to the foundational sequence of computer science courses, where CS1 is an introductory course in programming, and CS2 is a course that focuses on data structures and more advanced programming concepts. Here's a brief overview of the curricular guidelines that mention CS1 and CS2:

- Curriculum 68 (1968): Does not specifically use the terms CS1 and CS2.
- Curriculum 78 (1978): Refers to the terms CS1 and CS2.
- Computing Curricula 1991 (CC1991): Uses the terms CS1 and CS2.
- Computing Curricula 2001 (CC2001): Refers to CS1 and CS2 in the context of introductory courses, but with less emphasis.
- Computing Curricula 2005 (CC2005): Does not explicitly use the terms CS1 and CS2.
- Computer Science Curricula 2013 (CS2013): Refers to CS1 and CS2 in the context of introductory courses, but with less emphasis.
- Computing Curricula 2020 (CC2020): Does not explicitly use the terms CS1 and CS2.

While the terminology of CS1 and CS2 might not be explicitly mentioned in the most recent curricular guidelines (CC2020), the concepts behind them are still relevant. The CC2020 guidelines provide learning outcomes and topics for introductory programming courses (similar to CS1 and CS2) under the "Algorithms and Complexity" and "Programming Languages" knowledge areas.

In summary, the terms CS1 and CS2 might not be explicitly used in the latest ACM/IEEE curricular guidelines, but the concepts behind these foundational computer science courses remain relevant and are covered within the broader framework of the guidelines.

What are the most common 1st, 2nd, and 3rd year courses in computer science?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The most common computer science courses in the first, second, and third years of an undergraduate program may vary between institutions, but there are some core subjects that are typically covered during these years. Here's a general list of common courses for each year:

First Year
^^^^^^^^^^^

- Introduction to Programming (CS1) - Often taught using languages like Python, Java, or C++
- Discrete Mathematics - Covers topics such as logic, set theory, relations, functions, and combinatorics
- Computer Organization and Architecture - Introduces concepts like digital logic, memory systems, and processor design
- Data Structures and Algorithms (CS2) - Explores foundational data structures (e.g., arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs) and algorithms (e.g., searching, sorting)
 
Second Year
^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Algorithms and Complexity - Covers advanced algorithm design, analysis, and complexity theory
- Operating Systems - Explores the fundamentals of operating system design, process management, and memory management
- Computer Networks - Introduces network protocols, layers, and architectures
- Object-Oriented Programming and Design - Teaches principles of object-oriented programming, design patterns, and software engineering practices

Third Year
^^^^^^^^^^^

- Databases - Covers database design, SQL, and relational database management systems
- Software Engineering - Introduces software development processes, methodologies, and tools for large-scale projects
- Web Development or Mobile App Development - Teaches principles of web or mobile app development using modern frameworks and tools
- Artificial Intelligence and/or Machine Learning - Explores AI concepts, search algorithms, machine learning techniques, and neural networks

In addition to these core courses, students typically have the option to take elective courses in specialized areas such as cybersecurity, computer graphics, game development, human-computer interaction, data science, and more. The specific courses offered and their sequence may vary between institutions, but the list above provides a general overview of the common courses in a typical undergraduate computer science program.

It is important to note that this is a general overview, and the actual course offerings and sequence may differ among institutions. It's always a good idea to consult the specific curriculum and course catalog of the institution you're interested in for more accurate information.
