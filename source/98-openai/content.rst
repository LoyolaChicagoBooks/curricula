Background
=============

When was the first computer science program created?
-------------------------------------------------------

The first computer science program can be traced back to 1962, when Purdue University established the first Department of Computer Science in the United States. At that time, computer science was a relatively new field, and many universities had only offered computer-related courses as part of their mathematics or engineering programs.

As interest in computer science grew, more universities began to create dedicated computer science programs. By the late 1960s and early 1970s, many universities around the world had established computer science departments and degree programs. The development of these programs was further supported by organizations like the ACM and the IEEE Computer Society, which provided curriculum recommendations and guidelines to help standardize computer science education.

When were the first curricular guidelines for computer science degrees established?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The first curricular guidelines for computer science degrees were published in 1968 by the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM). The report, titled "Curriculum 68: Recommendations for Academic Programs in Computer Science," provided a framework for institutions to develop undergraduate computer science programs.

"Curriculum 68" aimed to define the core components of a computer science education and offer guidance on organizing courses and content. It was a landmark document that helped shape the early development of computer science as an academic discipline. Since then, the ACM has periodically updated its curriculum recommendations to keep pace with the rapidly evolving field of computer science.

You can find the "Curriculum 68" report at the following link:

Is there a URL for this that is on ACM and not on some random site?
---------------------------------------------------------------------

The original "Curriculum 68" report is not directly available on the ACM website. As it is an older document, it might not be readily accessible in digital format on the ACM's official site.

However, you can find a historical overview and analysis of the "Curriculum 68" and other early curricular guidelines in an article published by the ACM titled "The History of Computing Curricula 1965-2009" by Eric Roberts. This article provides valuable insights into the development of computer science curricula over the years.

Great, can you give me a list of all versions of ACM and IEEE computing curricular guidelines?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The ACM and IEEE Computer Society have been collaborating on computing curricula guidelines for several decades. Here is a list of the major versions of the ACM and IEEE computing curricular guidelines:

Curriculum 68: Recommendations for Academic Programs in Computer Science (1968)

- Developed by ACM
- URL: http://bitsavers.trailing-edge.com/pdf/acm/Curriculum68.pdf

Curriculum 78: Recommendations for the Undergraduate Program in Computer Science (1978)
