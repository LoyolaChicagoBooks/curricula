Basic object-oriented programming
---------------------------------


In the context of CS2, what are the essential elements of OOP?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the context of CS2 (second course in computer science), the essential elements of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) include the following:  
 
1. Classes: Classes are the fundamental building blocks of object-oriented programming. They define the blueprint or template for creating objects. A class encapsulates data (attributes) and behavior (methods) related to a specific concept or entity.

2. Objects: Objects are instances of classes. They represent specific occurrences of the concepts defined by the class. Objects have their own unique state (attribute values) and can perform actions (methods) defined by the class.

3. Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the principle of bundling data and methods within a single entity (class) and restricting direct access to internal implementation details. It promotes information hiding and allows for the abstraction and modular organization of code.

4. Inheritance: Inheritance allows for the creation of new classes (child or derived classes) based on existing classes (parent or base classes). It facilitates code reuse by inheriting attributes and behaviors from the parent class, enabling hierarchical relationships and polymorphism.

5. Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common parent class, enabling objects to respond to the same messages (method calls) in different ways. It promotes code flexibility, extensibility, and the ability to write generic code.

6. Abstraction: Abstraction involves representing essential features and behaviors of a concept while hiding unnecessary details. It allows for the creation of abstract classes and interfaces that define common characteristics and behaviors shared by multiple classes.

7. Modularity: Modularity emphasizes organizing code into separate, self-contained modules (classes) that focus on specific aspects of the problem domain. It promotes code organization, reusability, and maintainability.


Enums, classes, and records
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Here is a simple example in Java that covers classes, records (introduced in Java 14), enums, constructors, accessors, mutators, and the use of `public` and `private` members:

First, we'll create an `enum` to represent a type of a pet:

.. code-block:: java

    public enum PetType {
        DOG,
        CAT,
        BIRD
    }


Next, we'll create a `class` to represent a Pet with fields, constructors, accessors, and mutators:

.. code-block:: java

    public class Pet {
        private String name;
        private PetType type;

        public Pet(final String name, final PetType type) {
            this.name = name;
            this.type = type;
        }

        public String getName() {
            return this.name;
        }

        public void setName(final String name) {
            this.name = name;
        }

        public PetType getType() {
            return this.type;
        }

        public void setType(final PetType type) {
            this.type = type;
        }

        @Override
        public String toString() {
            return "Pet{" +
                    "name='" + name + '\'' +
                    ", type=" + type +
                    '}';
        }
    }


Next, we'll create a `record` to represent an Owner. Records are a compact way to declare classes which are transparent holders for shallowly immutable data:

.. code-block:: java

    public record Owner(String name, String address) { }


Finally, we can create instances of our classes and manipulate them:

.. code-block:: java

    public class Main {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            final var pet = new Pet("Fido", PetType.DOG);
            final var owner = new Owner("John Doe", "123 Main St");

            System.out.println(pet);
            System.out.println(owner);

            pet.setName("Spot");
            System.out.println(pet);
        }
    }


This example demonstrates encapsulation: the `Pet` class's `name` and `type` fields are `private`, so they can't be accessed directly from outside the class. Instead, they are accessed and modified through `public` accessor (getter) and mutator (setter) methods. The `Owner` record also demonstrates encapsulation, though in a different way: its fields are `public`, but they are `final` and can't be modified after the record is created. The `PetType` enum demonstrates a basic use of enums to represent a fixed set of values.


*Very nice and comprehensive. But why does Pet have a setType method? Can Fido become a cat?!?*

Great observation! In many real-world scenarios, some properties of an object might not change after its creation. In the case of a `Pet`, the `type` (whether it's a dog, cat, or bird) would realistically never change. Therefore, it would make more sense to omit the `setType` method to ensure the `type` field remains constant after the `Pet` object is created, which represents the concept of immutability.

Here's the adjusted `Pet` class:

.. code-block:: java

    public class Pet {
        private String name;
        private final PetType type;

        public Pet(final String name, final PetType type) {
            this.name = name;
            this.type = type;
        }

        public String getName() {
            return this.name;
        }

        public void setName(final String name) {
            this.name = name;
        }

        public PetType getType() {
            return this.type;
        }

        @Override
        public String toString() {
            return "Pet{" +
                    "name='" + name + '\'' +
                    ", type=" + type +
                    '}';
        }
    }


Now the `type` is marked as `final` and there's no `setType` method, meaning the `type` can't be changed after a `Pet` object is created. If you want to create a pet of a different type, you would need to create a new `Pet` object. This is more representative of the real world, where a pet's species can't change.

Associations between classes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. warning:: Ran out of GPT-4 queries here.


The relationship between pets and owners can be represented using an association or aggregation relationship. Let's consider the `Pet` class and the `Owner` record.

In this scenario, an `Owner` can have one or more `Pet` objects, and a `Pet` can belong to a single `Owner`. This relationship can be represented by adding a reference to the `Owner` class in the `Pet` class.

Here's an updated version of the code to illustrate the relationship:

.. code-block:: java

    public class Pet {
        private String name;
        private PetType type;
        private Owner owner;

        public Pet(final String name, final PetType type, final Owner owner) {
            this.name = name;
            this.type = type;
            this.owner = owner;
        }

        // Getter and setter methods for name, type, and owner

        @Override
        public String toString() {
            return "Pet{" +
                    "name='" + name + '\'' +
                    ", type=" + type +
                    ", owner=" + owner +
                    '}';
        }
    }

    public record Owner(String name, String address) {
    }


In the updated `Pet` class, we added a field `owner` of type `Owner` to represent the owner of the pet. The `Owner` class remains unchanged.

With this association, you can now create `Pet` objects and assign them to an `Owner`. Here's an example:

.. code-block:: java

    public class Main {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            final var owner = new Owner("John Doe", "123 Main St");

            final var pet1 = new Pet("Fido", PetType.DOG, owner);
            final var pet2 = new Pet("Whiskers", PetType.CAT, owner);

            System.out.println(pet1);
            System.out.println(pet2);
        }
    }


This will output:

.. code-block:: 

    Pet{name='Fido', type=DOG, owner=Owner[name=John Doe, address=123 Main St]}
    Pet{name='Whiskers', type=CAT, owner=Owner[name=John Doe, address=123 Main St]}


Now, each `Pet` object has a reference to its respective `Owner`. This allows you to establish the relationship between pets and owners and retrieve the owner information when needed.

It's important to note that this example illustrates a simplified association relationship. In more complex scenarios, you might encounter different types of relationships like composition or bidirectional associations. The choice of the appropriate relationship type depends on the specific requirements and design of the system.


Subtype polymorphism
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*For this Pet class, how would you define behaviors that are specific to a type of pet, such as a dog barking and a cat meowing?*

To represent behaviors specific to different types of pets, you can use polymorphism and inheritance in object-oriented programming. You could define a base class or interface `Pet` and then create subclasses for each specific type of pet. Each subclass can then implement its own version of the behavior methods. Here's an example:

First, we'll define the base class `Pet`:

.. code-block:: java

    public abstract class Pet {
        private String name;

        public Pet(final String name) {
            this.name = name;
        }

        public String getName() {
            return this.name;
        }

        public void setName(final String name) {
            this.name = name;
        }

        // abstract method for the pet to make a sound
        public abstract String makeSound();
    }


Then, we'll create `Dog` and `Cat` classes that extend `Pet` and implement the `makeSound` method:

.. code-block:: java

    public class Dog extends Pet {
        public Dog(final String name) {
            super(name);
        }

        @Override
        public String makeSound() {
            return "Bark!";
        }
    }

    public class Cat extends Pet {
        public Cat(final String name) {
            super(name);
        }

        @Override
        public String makeSound() {
            return "Meow!";
        }
    }


Finally, we can create `Dog` and `Cat` objects and call their `makeSound` methods:

.. code-block:: java

    public class Main {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            final var dog = new Dog("Fido");
            final var cat = new Cat("Whiskers");

            System.out.println(dog.getName() + " says: " + dog.makeSound());
            System.out.println(cat.getName() + " says: " + cat.makeSound());
        }
    }


This will output:

.. code-block:: 

    Fido says: Bark!
    Whiskers says: Meow!


In this way, we've represented behaviors specific to different types of pets. Each type of pet can have its own unique behaviors, while still sharing common attributes and behaviors through the `Pet` base class.


Subclasses and method overriding
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Aren't there some dogs that howl rather than bark? Can we enhance our class hierarchy accordingly?*

To handle this, we can introduce another layer in our class hierarchy. Let's create a `Dog` subclass called `Husky`, which overrides the `makeSound` method to return "Howl!" instead of "Bark!". Here's how you can do it:

.. code-block:: java

    public class Husky extends Dog {
        public Husky(final String name) {
            super(name);
        }

        @Override
        public String makeSound() {
            return "Howl!";
        }
    }


Now you can create a `Husky` object, add it to the `pets` list, and see that it howls instead of barks:

.. code-block:: java

    public class Main {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            // Create a list of pets
            final var pets = new ArrayList<Pet>();
            pets.add(new Dog("Fido"));
            pets.add(new Cat("Whiskers"));
            pets.add(new Husky("Balto"));

            // Make each pet make its sound
            for (final var pet : pets) {
                System.out.println(pet.getName() + " says: " + pet.makeSound());
            }
        }
    }


This will output:

.. code-block:: 

    Fido says: Bark!
    Whiskers says: Meow!
    Balto says: Howl!


This demonstrates the flexibility of object-oriented programming. By creating a subclass and overriding methods, you can create variations of a base class that behave differently. And thanks to polymorphism, you can handle objects of the base class and its subclasses in a unified way.


Interfaces
^^^^^^^^^^

Interfaces provide a way to define common behavior and can be utilized in this example to further enhance the design. Let's introduce an interface called `Soundable` to represent pets that can make sounds. Here's an updated version that incorporates interfaces:

.. code-block:: java

    import java.util.ArrayList;
    import java.util.List;

    public interface Soundable {
        String makeSound();
    }

    public abstract class Pet {
        private String name;
        private Owner owner;

        public Pet(final String name, final Owner owner) {
            this.name = name;
            this.owner = owner;
        }

        public String getName() {
            return name;
        }

        public Owner getOwner() {
            return owner;
        }

        public void setOwner(final Owner owner) {
            this.owner = owner;
        }

        @Override
        public String toString() {
            return "Pet{" +
                    "name='" + name + '\'' +
                    ", owner=" + owner +
                    '}';
        }
    }

    public class Dog extends Pet implements Soundable {
        public Dog(final String name, final Owner owner) {
            super(name, owner);
        }

        @Override
        public String makeSound() {
            return "Bark!";
        }
    }

    public class Cat extends Pet implements Soundable {
        public Cat(final String name, final Owner owner) {
            super(name, owner);
        }

        @Override
        public String makeSound() {
            return "Meow!";
        }
    }

    public record Owner(String name, String address) {
    }

    public class Main {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            final var owner = new Owner("John Doe", "123 Main St");

            final var pets = new ArrayList<Soundable>();
            pets.add(new Dog("Fido", owner));
            pets.add(new Cat("Whiskers", owner));

            for (final var pet : pets) {
                System.out.println(pet.getName() + " says: " + pet.makeSound());
            }
        }
    }


In this updated version, we introduce the `Soundable` interface, which declares the `makeSound` method. Both `Dog` and `Cat` classes implement this interface, indicating that they can make sounds.

The `ArrayList` is now defined as `ArrayList<Soundable>`, allowing it to hold objects that implement the `Soundable` interface. This way, we can ensure that all pets in the list can make sounds.

By iterating over the `pets` list and treating each pet as a `Soundable`, we can call the `getName` and `makeSound` methods for each pet.

The output will remain the same:

.. code-block:: 

    Fido says: Bark!
    Whiskers says: Meow!


This updated version showcases the usage of interfaces to define common behavior and achieve a higher level of abstraction. By utilizing the `Soundable` interface, we can easily manage a list of pets that can make sounds, regardless of their specific pet type.


*Finally, can you add back the husky?*

Certainly! Here's the updated version that includes the `Husky` class back into the example, leveraging interfaces and inheritance:

.. code-block:: java

    import java.util.ArrayList;
    import java.util.List;

    public interface Soundable {
        String makeSound();
    }

    public abstract class Pet {
        private String name;
        private Owner owner;

        public Pet(final String name, final Owner owner) {
            this.name = name;
            this.owner = owner;
        }

        public String getName() {
            return name;
        }

        public Owner getOwner() {
            return owner;
        }

        public void setOwner(final Owner owner) {
            this.owner = owner;
        }

        @Override
        public String toString() {
            return "Pet{" +
                    "name='" + name + '\'' +
                    ", owner=" + owner +
                    '}';
        }
    }

    public class Dog extends Pet implements Soundable {
        public Dog(final String name, final Owner owner) {
            super(name, owner);
        }

        @Override
        public String makeSound() {
            return "Bark!";
        }
    }

    public class Cat extends Pet implements Soundable {
        public Cat(final String name, final Owner owner) {
            super(name, owner);
        }

        @Override
        public String makeSound() {
            return "Meow!";
        }
    }

    public class Husky extends Dog {
        public Husky(final String name, final Owner owner) {
            super(name, owner);
        }

        @Override
        public String makeSound() {
            return "Howl!";
        }
    }

    public record Owner(String name, String address) {
    }

    public class Main {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            final var owner = new Owner("John Doe", "123 Main St");

            final var pets = new ArrayList<Soundable>();
            pets.add(new Dog("Fido", owner));
            pets.add(new Cat("Whiskers", owner));
            pets.add(new Husky("Balto", owner));

            for (final var pet : pets) {
                System.out.println(pet.getName() + " says: " + pet.makeSound());
            }
        }
    }


In this updated version, we reintroduce the `Husky` class, which extends the `Dog` class and implements the `Soundable` interface. The `Husky` class overrides the `makeSound` method to return "Howl!".

We include an instance of `Husky` in the `pets` list alongside the `Dog` and `Cat` instances. As all three classes implement the `Soundable` interface, they can be added to the list.

When iterating over the `pets` list, each pet's `makeSound` method is called based on its actual type, producing the appropriate sound for each pet.

The output will be:

.. code-block:: 

    Fido says: Bark!
    Whiskers says: Meow!
    Balto says: Howl!


This updated version demonstrates the utilization of interfaces, inheritance, and polymorphism to handle different types of pets with varying behaviors in a unified way.


Where does subtyping fit in?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Subtyping is an important concept in object-oriented programming and is closely related to inheritance. It allows for the substitution of objects of one class with objects of another class that is derived from or related to the former class. 

Subtyping enables polymorphism and supports the "is-a" relationship between classes. It allows objects of a derived class to be treated as objects of their parent class, providing flexibility and extensibility in program design. By leveraging subtyping, code can be written in a way that is more generic and adaptable to different types of objects.

In the context of CS2, subtyping is a significant aspect of understanding inheritance and polymorphism. It enables students to create class hierarchies, define relationships between classes, and utilize the principles of code reuse and abstraction. By grasping the concept of subtyping, students can effectively design and implement object-oriented programs that utilize inheritance and polymorphism to their full potential.

Where would you put delegation?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Delegation is a concept that can be closely related to both composition and inheritance in object-oriented programming. It involves one object (delegate) handing off a specific task or responsibility to another object (delegator). 

In terms of its placement, delegation can be seen as a design pattern or technique that can be applied in various parts of an object-oriented program. It is not necessarily a core element of OOP like classes, objects, inheritance, or polymorphism, but rather a flexible approach to achieve code reuse and modularity.

Delegation can be utilized within the methods or behaviors of a class, where a specific task or functionality is delegated to another object responsible for performing that task. This allows the delegator object to rely on the expertise or specialized behavior of the delegate object without inheriting from it.

Additionally, delegation can also be used at a higher level in the design of a system, where an object delegates certain responsibilities or operations to other objects to achieve a more modular and loosely coupled architecture. This promotes the separation of concerns and enhances code maintainability and flexibility.

In summary, delegation is a technique that can be applied within the methods of a class or at a higher level in the system design. It is a flexible approach that allows objects to delegate specific tasks to other objects, promoting code reuse, modularity, and separation of concerns.


8. Delegation: Delegation is a technique where one object (delegator) hands off a specific task or responsibility to another object (delegate). It allows objects to rely on the specialized behavior of other objects without directly inheriting from them, promoting code reuse and modular design.


In practice, shouldn't delegation be on par with inheritance?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In practice, both delegation and inheritance are important concepts in object-oriented programming, but they serve different purposes and have distinct advantages and use cases. While inheritance is a mechanism for creating class hierarchies and sharing behavior and attributes between classes, delegation is a technique for achieving code reuse and modularity by handing off specific tasks or responsibilities to other objects.

The choice between delegation and inheritance depends on the specific requirements and design goals of the program. In some cases, inheritance may be more appropriate when there is a clear "is-a" relationship between classes and a need to share common behavior and attributes. Inheritance can provide a convenient way to define and organize class hierarchies, promote code reuse, and enable polymorphism.

On the other hand, delegation can be preferred when there is a need for more flexible and modular design. Delegation allows objects to delegate specific tasks to other objects that specialize in those tasks, enabling composition and separation of concerns. It promotes code reuse without requiring a rigid class hierarchy and allows objects to rely on the behavior of other objects without inheriting from them directly.

In practice, both inheritance and delegation are used together or in combination to achieve desired design goals. They are not mutually exclusive, and the choice between them often depends on the specific problem domain, the relationships between objects, and the desired flexibility and extensibility of the system.

So, while delegation is indeed an important technique in practice and can be used on par with inheritance in certain scenarios, it's important to consider the specific requirements and design goals to determine the most appropriate approach for a given situation.



Where do composition, aggregation, and association fit into this list?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

9. Composition: Composition is a strong "whole-part" relationship where the lifetime of the parts is tightly coupled with the lifetime of the whole. The whole object is responsible for creating and managing its component objects. If the whole object is destroyed, its parts are also destroyed. Composition is often represented by a class having one or more member variables of another class type.

10. Aggregation: Aggregation is a weaker form of composition, representing a relationship where one object (the aggregate) contains or is associated with other objects (the components). The components can exist independently of the aggregate, and their lifetimes are not necessarily tied to the aggregate's lifetime. Aggregation is often represented by a class having member variables that are references or pointers to other objects.

11. Association: Association represents a relationship between two or more objects, indicating that they are somehow connected or interact with each other. Unlike composition and aggregation, association doesn't imply ownership or lifetime dependencies between the associated objects. Associations can be represented through member variables, method parameters, or return values.
   
By understanding and effectively utilizing these essential elements of OOP, including delegation, students in CS2 can develop a strong foundation in object-oriented programming principles and apply them to create robust, maintainable, and flexible software solutions.

Composition, aggregation, and association are relationship types that expand the ways in which objects can interact and collaborate in an object-oriented system. They provide additional flexibility in designing object relationships, capturing different levels of ownership and dependency.

By understanding and utilizing composition, aggregation, and association, students in CS2 can create more expressive and accurate models of real-world systems, enabling them to design and implement object-oriented programs that accurately reflect the relationships and interactions between objects.


Is association related to delegation?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Association and delegation are distinct concepts in object-oriented programming, but they can be related in certain scenarios.

Association represents a relationship between two or more objects, indicating that they are somehow connected or interact with each other. It captures the concept of objects being aware of each other and potentially collaborating, but it does not imply any specific behavior or responsibility transfer.

Delegation, on the other hand, is a technique where one object (delegator) hands off a specific task or responsibility to another object (delegate). It involves one object relying on the specialized behavior of another object to fulfill a specific aspect of its functionality.

While association and delegation are separate concepts, they can coexist in a system. In some cases, an object involved in an association may delegate a specific task to another object. The object responsible for the delegated task can be considered the delegate in the context of delegation, even though there is an association between the delegator and the delegate.

The association between objects can provide the context or mechanism through which delegation occurs. The delegating object can access and interact with the delegate through the association. The association relationship can establish the connection necessary for delegation to take place.

In summary, association and delegation are related in the sense that delegation can occur within the context of an association. The association provides the linkage between objects, and the delegation allows one object to delegate specific responsibilities to another object, leveraging their specialized behavior.


Is composition related to delegation?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Composition and delegation are distinct concepts in object-oriented programming, but they can be related and often coexist in system design.

Composition refers to a strong "whole-part" relationship between objects, where the lifetime of the parts is tightly coupled with the lifetime of the whole. In composition, an object is composed of one or more component objects, and the components cannot exist independently outside of the composite object. The composite object takes responsibility for creating, managing, and coordinating the behavior of its component objects.

Delegation, on the other hand, is a technique where an object (delegator) hands off a specific task or responsibility to another object (delegate). The delegating object relies on the specialized behavior of the delegate object to perform that task.

In practice, delegation is often used within the context of composition. A composite object may delegate certain tasks or responsibilities to its component objects, allowing the components to handle specific aspects of functionality while the composite object orchestrates their collaboration. This delegation of tasks promotes modularity, code reuse, and separation of concerns.

By combining composition and delegation, complex behaviors can be achieved through a hierarchical organization of objects, where a composite object delegates tasks to its component objects, each responsible for a specific aspect of functionality.

For example, consider a composite object representing a car. The car object may internally contain component objects such as an engine, wheels, and a steering system. The car object, acting as the delegator, can delegate tasks like accelerating, turning, or braking to its component objects (delegate), which are specialized to handle those specific tasks. The delegation allows the car object to coordinate the overall behavior of the car while leveraging the specific functionalities provided by its components.

In summary, composition and delegation are related in the sense that delegation can occur within the context of composition. Composition establishes the strong whole-part relationship between objects, while delegation allows the composite object to delegate specific responsibilities to its component objects to achieve modular and specialized behavior.


What's the difference, if any, between composition and aggregation?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Composition and aggregation are both forms of object relationships in object-oriented programming, but they differ in terms of the strength of the relationship and the lifecycle dependency between the objects involved. Here's a breakdown of the differences:

Composition:

1. Strong Relationship: Composition represents a strong relationship between objects, where one object (the whole) is composed of other objects (the parts). The parts are owned by the whole, and their existence is tightly coupled with the existence of the whole.
2. Exclusive Ownership: In composition, the whole object takes ownership and responsibility for creating, managing, and destroying its component objects. The lifetime of the parts is dependent on the lifetime of the whole.
3. No Independent Existence: The parts typically do not have an independent existence outside of the whole object. They are created and destroyed as part of the whole, and their behavior is often tightly integrated with the overall behavior of the whole object.
4. Strong Encapsulation: Composition enforces strong encapsulation, as the internal structure and implementation details of the parts are typically not exposed to the external world. The whole object controls and encapsulates the behavior of its parts.

Aggregation:

1. Weaker Relationship: Aggregation represents a weaker relationship between objects, where one object (the aggregate) contains or is associated with other objects (the components). The components can exist independently of the aggregate object.
2. Shared Ownership: In aggregation, the components are not owned by the aggregate object. They may have their own independent lifecycles and can be shared between multiple aggregate objects.
3. Independent Existence: The components can exist outside of the aggregate object and can be associated with multiple aggregates or exist on their own.
4. Shared Responsibility: Unlike in composition, the components in aggregation can have their own behavior and responsibilities that are not solely governed by the aggregate object.
5. Weaker Encapsulation: Aggregation allows for looser encapsulation, as the components may have their own interfaces and can be accessed directly by external objects, independent of the aggregate object.

In summary, composition and aggregation differ in the strength of the relationship, ownership, lifecycle dependency, and encapsulation. Composition represents a strong ownership relationship with exclusive ownership and tight lifecycle dependency, while aggregation represents a looser relationship with shared ownership and independent existence of the components.

Here's an example that illustrates the concept of aggregation:

Consider a university system where a Department object represents a department within the university, and a Professor object represents a faculty member. In this scenario:

- Aggregation: The Department aggregates Professor objects as its faculty members. Multiple professors can be associated with a department, and they can exist independently outside of the department.

Example:

.. code-block:: java

   public class Professor {
       private String name;
       private String specialization;

       // Constructor, getters, and setters
   }

   public class Department {
       private String name;
       private List<Professor> faculty;

       // Constructor, getters, and setters
       public void addProfessor(final Professor professor) {
	   faculty.add(professor);
       }

       public void removeProfessor(final Professor professor) {
	   faculty.remove(professor);
       }
   }


In this example, the Department class has an aggregation relationship with the Professor class. Each Department object maintains a list of Professor objects as its faculty members. Professors can exist independently and can be associated with multiple departments or even exist without any department affiliation.

The Department class aggregates Professor objects by providing methods to add or remove professors from its faculty list. This allows the Department object to associate and interact with multiple Professor objects while maintaining their independent existence.

This aggregation relationship provides flexibility in terms of professors being able to switch departments or be associated with multiple departments without being tightly coupled to any specific department.

In summary, the aggregation relationship allows for the association of multiple objects while maintaining their independent existence and provides a looser relationship compared to composition.


 Here's an example of composition using the car analogy:

.. code-block:: java

   public class Engine {
       public void start() {
	   // Code to start the engine
	   System.out.println("Engine started.");
       }

       public void stop() {
	   // Code to stop the engine
	   System.out.println("Engine stopped.");
       }
   }

   public record Wheel(int size) {
       public void rotate() {
	   // Code to rotate the wheel
	   System.out.println("Wheel rotating.");
       }
   }

   public class Car {
       private Engine engine;
       private List<Wheel> wheels;

       public Car() {
	   engine = new Engine();
           wheels = List.of(new Wheel(18), new Wheel(18), new Wheel(18), new Wheel(18));
       }

       public void startCar() {
	   engine.start();
	   System.out.println("Car started.");
       }

       public void stopCar() {
	   engine.stop();
	   System.out.println("Car stopped.");
       }

       public void drive() {
	   for (final var wheel : wheels) {
	       wheel.rotate();
	   }
	   System.out.println("Car is driving.");
       }
   }

   public class Main {
       public static void main(final String[] args) {
	   final var car = new Car();
	   car.startCar();
	   car.drive();
	   car.stopCar();
       }
   }


In this example, we have three classes: `Engine`, `Wheel`, and `Car`. The `Car` class composes an `Engine` object and a list of `Wheel` objects. The `Car` class creates and owns these objects, and their lifetimes are tied to the lifetime of the `Car` object.

When the `Car` object is created, it initializes its `Engine` and creates four `Wheel` objects. The `Car` class encapsulates the behavior of the engine and wheels and provides methods to start the car, stop the car, and drive the car.

In the `Main` class, we create a `Car` object and invoke the `startCar()`, `drive()`, and `stopCar()` methods to demonstrate the composition relationship. The `Car` object delegates the responsibility of starting the engine and rotating the wheels to its composed objects, providing the functionality of a fully functioning car.

Executing the code will produce the following output:


.. code-block::
   
   Engine started.
   Car started.
   Wheel rotating.
   Wheel rotating.
   Wheel rotating.
   Wheel rotating.
   Car is driving.
   Engine stopped.
   Car stopped.


This example demonstrates how the `Car` object composes the `Engine` and `Wheel` objects, utilizing their behaviors and encapsulating them within its own functionality.

Only observable relationships matter
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


*If a relationship between class and another class is purely internal, without public members to observe the relationship, it's as if it didn't exist, right? For example, if class A has a private field of class B but class B doesn't occur in any constructor or method parameters or return types, we shouldn't say A has-a B, should we?*

Yes, you are correct. If a relationship between two classes is purely internal and not observable from outside the class, it can be considered as if it doesn't exist in terms of the class's public interface. In the scenario you described, where class A has a private field of class B but class B doesn't occur in any constructor or method parameters or return types, we wouldn't typically say that class A "has-a" relationship with class B.

The concept of "has-a" relationship usually implies that a class directly incorporates or contains another class as a part of its public interface, visible to external entities. It signifies a stronger association where the presence of the associated class is observable and relevant to the class's behavior and interactions.

In your example, since class B is not part of class A's public interface and is purely internal, it wouldn't be accurate to describe it as a "has-a" relationship. The internal usage of class B within class A is an implementation detail, and class B's existence is not visible or relevant to external entities interacting with class A.

However, it's worth noting that the internal usage of class B can still be important for the implementation and internal functioning of class A. It helps encapsulate the necessary behavior and state within class A without exposing the details of class B to external entities.

In summary, if a relationship between two classes is purely internal and not observable from outside the class, it is not typically described as a "has-a" relationship in terms of the class's public interface.
