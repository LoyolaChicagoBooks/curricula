Programming Languages (LUC COMP 371)
==========================================

.. todo:: If this is a book, shouldn't these top-level units be chapters rather than sections? 

.. note:: Konstantin to map for us. 

.. note:: Will need consistent way to refer to other courses, such as prerequisites CS3 and CS7


Prerequisites
-------------

The prerequisites for this course are

- COMP 264
- COMP 272

This course assumes familiarity with the imperative programming
paradigm and a basic understanding of the object-oriented programming paradigm.
  

Overview
--------

.. todo::
   Discuss whether we'll leave advanced OO to 313/373 and include XML/XSLT instead!
   OTOH, the markup languages course already covers the latter in depth.

This course provides an overview of the most significant programming paradigms and introduces the student to a paradigm-defining language for each of these paradigms. 

- object-oriented programming (beyond the prerequisite basics): Scala
- functional programming: Haskell
- concurrent programming: Clojure
- logic programming: Prolog
