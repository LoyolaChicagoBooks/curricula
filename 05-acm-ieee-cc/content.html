<h1>ACM/IEEE Curricular Standards<a class="headerlink" href="#acm-ieee-curricular-standards" title="Permalink to this heading">Â¶</a></h1>
<p>The Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) is a leading international organization for computing professionals, and they periodically release guidelines for computing curricula to help educational institutions design their programs.</p>
<p>The ACM curriculum guidelines cover various aspects of computing education, including computer science, information systems, information technology, software engineering, and cybersecurity. These guidelines aim to provide a framework for colleges and universities to develop comprehensive, relevant, and up-to-date computing programs.</p>
<p>Here are some key components of the ACM computing curriculum:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Core knowledge areas: The curriculum is divided into several knowledge areas, such as algorithms and complexity, programming languages, software development fundamentals, systems, and computer organization and architecture.</p></li>
<li><p>Elective knowledge areas: In addition to the core knowledge areas, the ACM curriculum also offers elective areas to allow students to specialize in specific topics, such as artificial intelligence, human-computer interaction, and data science.</p></li>
<li><p>Skill development: The curriculum emphasizes the development of skills such as problem-solving, critical thinking, communication, and teamwork.</p></li>
<li><p>Ethical considerations: The ACM curriculum incorporates ethical considerations in computing, such as understanding the social impact of technology, privacy issues, and professional responsibility.</p></li>
<li><p>Project-based learning: The curriculum encourages hands-on, project-based learning to help students apply their knowledge in real-world situations.</p></li>
<li><p>Continuous improvement: The ACM regularly updates its curriculum guidelines to keep up with the rapidly evolving field of computing.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Letâ€™s take a look at specificlearning outcomes (George and William to check) for typical computing (computing-related) degree programs.
For this analysis, we are looking at programs <em>we</em> offer at Loyola University Chicago:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>B.S. in Computer Science</p></li>
<li><p>B.S. in Software Engineering</p></li>
<li><p>B.S. in Information Technology</p></li>
<li><p>B.S. in Cybersecurity</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We offer others:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>B.S. in Physics + Computer Science</p></li>
<li><p>B.S. in Mathematics + Computer Science</p></li>
<li><p>B.S. in Bioinformatics</p></li>
<li><p>B.S. in Neuroscience [Computational Neuroscience]</p></li>
<li><p>B.S. in Data Science</p></li>

<h2>B.S. in Computer Science<a class="headerlink" href="#b-s-in-computer-science" title="Permalink to this heading" x-intersect.margin.0%.0%.-70%.0%="activeSection = '#b-s-in-computer-science'">Â¶</a></h2>
<p>In a Bachelor of Science (B.S.) in Computer Science program, the curriculum typically aims to achieve a set of outcomes to prepare students for a wide range of computer science related careers, or for further academic pursuits in the field. Here are some of the most common program outcomes:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p><strong>Knowledge of Core Computer Science Concepts</strong>: This includes understanding data structures, algorithms, computer architecture, principles of software engineering, databases, networking, and more. The goal is to give students a comprehensive grounding in the key ideas that underpin computer science.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Problem-Solving Skills</strong>: Graduates should be able to use their knowledge of computer science to solve complex problems. This includes the ability to design, implement, and evaluate a computational system to meet a given set of requirements.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Proficiency in Programming</strong>: Students should be proficient in at least one high-level programming language and have experience with several others. They should also be familiar with the principles of programming languages and be able to learn new languages as needed.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Understanding of Mathematical and Scientific Principles</strong>: Graduates should understand the mathematical and scientific principles that underpin computer science. This includes discrete mathematics, probability and statistics, and more.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Ethical and Social Implications</strong>: An understanding of professional, ethical, legal, security, and social issues and responsibilities as they pertain to computer science.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Teamwork and Communication</strong>: Students should be able to work effectively on teams to accomplish a common goal, and they should be able to communicate their ideas and work effectively both verbally and in writing.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Ability to Learn Independently</strong>: As technology continually evolves, itâ€™s crucial that students develop the ability to learn new tools, techniques, and concepts independently.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Understanding of Software Development Practices</strong>: This includes knowledge of different software development methodologies, as well as experience with software testing, debugging, and version control.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Preparation for Continued Study or Work</strong>: Students should be prepared to enter a top graduate program in computer science or to begin a professional career in the field.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Application of Computer Science</strong>: Students should be able to apply computer science methods and tools to another field of interest, such as biology, finance, or art.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>These outcomes can vary depending on the institution, but the ones listed above are common to many B.S. in Computer Science programs.</p>

<h3>What data structures are typically needed in a B.S. in Bioinformatics degree?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-data-structures-are-typically-needed-in-a-b-s-in-bioinformatics-degree" title="Permalink to this heading" x-intersect.margin.0%.0%.-70%.0%="activeSection = '#what-data-structures-are-typically-needed-in-a-b-s-in-bioinformatics-degree'">Â¶</a></h3>
<p>Bioinformatics often deals with large and complex biological data sets, and understanding the right data structures can be crucial for processing this data efficiently. Here are some data structures commonly used in bioinformatics:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p><strong>Arrays and Lists</strong>: These are fundamental data structures in any programming language, used for storing and manipulating collections of elements. In bioinformatics, they can be used to store sequences of nucleotides or amino acids.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Strings</strong>: Strings are essential for representing and manipulating biological sequences such as DNA, RNA, and protein sequences.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Hash Tables (Dictionaries)</strong>: These are used to store and retrieve data in constant time. They can be used for tasks such as counting the frequency of specific nucleotide sequences in a DNA string or mapping genes to their associated information.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Trees</strong>: Particularly, Binary Trees and Balanced Search Trees are used in various bioinformatics algorithms. Phylogenetic trees, which represent the evolutionary relationships among various biological species, are one example.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Graphs</strong>: Graphs are used to model various biological phenomena. For example, protein-protein interaction networks, gene regulatory networks, and metabolic pathways can all be represented as graphs. In sequence assembly, De Bruijn graphs are a commonly used data structure.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Priority Queues/Heaps</strong>: Used in many algorithms, including those for genome assembly and sequence alignment.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Tries</strong>: These are tree-like structures that are particularly useful for storing and searching large biological sequences efficiently.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Suffix Trees and Arrays</strong>: These are specialized data structures used in string matching problems, which are common in bioinformatics.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Each of these data structures has strengths and weaknesses depending on the specific problem being solved, so itâ€™s essential to understand their characteristics and when to use each one.</p>
