<h2>ACM/IEEE<a class="headerlink" href="#acm-ieee" title="Permalink to this heading" x-intersect.margin.0%.0%.-70%.0%="activeSection = '#acm-ieee'">¶</a></h2>
<p>The Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) is a leading international organization for computing professionals, and they periodically release guidelines for computing curricula to help educational institutions design their programs.</p>
<p>The ACM curriculum guidelines cover various aspects of computing education, including computer science, information systems, information technology, software engineering, and cybersecurity. These guidelines aim to provide a framework for colleges and universities to develop comprehensive, relevant, and up-to-date computing programs.</p>
<p>Here are some key components of the ACM computing curriculum:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Core knowledge areas: The curriculum is divided into several knowledge areas, such as algorithms and complexity, programming languages, software development fundamentals, systems, and computer organization and architecture.</p></li>
<li><p>Elective knowledge areas: In addition to the core knowledge areas, the ACM curriculum also offers elective areas to allow students to specialize in specific topics, such as artificial intelligence, human-computer interaction, and data science.</p></li>
<li><p>Skill development: The curriculum emphasizes the development of skills such as problem-solving, critical thinking, communication, and teamwork.</p></li>
<li><p>Ethical considerations: The ACM curriculum incorporates ethical considerations in computing, such as understanding the social impact of technology, privacy issues, and professional responsibility.</p></li>
<li><p>Project-based learning: The curriculum encourages hands-on, project-based learning to help students apply their knowledge in real-world situations.</p></li>
<li><p>Continuous improvement: The ACM regularly updates its curriculum guidelines to keep up with the rapidly evolving field of computing.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>ABET<a class="headerlink" href="#abet" title="Permalink to this heading" x-intersect.margin.0%.0%.-70%.0%="activeSection = '#abet'">¶</a></h2>
<p>While ABET (Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology) does generally align with ACM (Association for Computing Machinery) and IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers), there are slight differences in how they express program outcomes. This is primarily because ABET covers a wider range of disciplines, including applied and natural science, computing, engineering, and engineering technology, while ACM and IEEE’s Computer Society specifically target computing and related fields.</p>
<p>ABET uses a set of “Student Outcomes” (labeled 1-7) for programs in computing:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>An ability to analyze a complex computing problem and to apply principles of computing and other relevant disciplines to identify solutions.</p></li>
<li><p>An ability to design, implement, and evaluate a computing-based solution to meet a given set of computing requirements in the context of the program’s discipline.</p></li>
<li><p>An ability to communicate effectively in a variety of professional contexts.</p></li>
<li><p>An ability to recognize professional responsibilities and make informed judgments in computing practice based on legal and ethical principles.</p></li>
<li><p>An ability to function effectively as a member or leader of a team engaged in activities appropriate to the program’s discipline.</p></li>
<li><p>An ability to apply computer science theory and software development fundamentals to produce computing-based solutions.</p></li>
<li><p>A familiarity with the impact of computing on individuals, organizations, and society, including ethical, legal, security, and global policy issues.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>This is quite similar to ACM and IEEE’s outcomes, but with a slightly broader perspective that considers the impacts of computing on society and the ethical responsibilities of computing professionals. ABET also places strong emphasis on communication skills and teamwork.</p>

<h2>NICE<a class="headerlink" href="#nice" title="Permalink to this heading" x-intersect.margin.0%.0%.-70%.0%="activeSection = '#nice'">¶</a></h2>
<p>The National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE), led by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in the U.S., doesn’t provide a specific curriculum structure for Cybersecurity B.S. programs, but they do provide a comprehensive Framework that can guide educational institutions in developing or improving Cybersecurity programs.</p>
<p>The NICE Cybersecurity Workforce Framework (NICE Framework) organizes cybersecurity work into 7 high-level categories, each containing several specialty areas. These categories are:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p><strong>Securely Provision (SP)</strong>: Conceptualize, design, procure, and/or build secure information technology (IT) systems.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Operate and Maintain (OM)</strong>: Provide support, administration, and maintenance necessary to ensure effective and efficient IT system performance and security.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Oversee and Govern (OV)</strong>: Provide leadership, management, direction, or development and advocacy so the organization may effectively conduct cybersecurity work.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Protect and Defend (PR)</strong>: Identify, analyze, and mitigate threats to internal IT systems and/or networks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Analyze (AN)</strong>: Perform highly specialized review and evaluation of incoming cybersecurity information to determine its usefulness for intelligence.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Collect and Operate (CO)</strong>: Provide specialized denial and deception operations and collection of cybersecurity information that may be used to develop intelligence.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Investigate (IN)</strong>: Investigate cybersecurity events or crimes related to information technology (IT) systems, networks, and digital evidence.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In each specialty area, the Framework lists a set of Abilities, Knowledge, and Skills (KSA) required, as well as specific tasks often associated with work in that area.</p>
<p>When developing a B.S. program in Cybersecurity, educational institutions can use the NICE Framework as a reference to ensure that their curriculum covers the essential areas of cybersecurity work and provides students with the required KSAs.</p>
<div class="admonition note">

<h3>Is Calculus required for the CS1 (Introduction to CS) course?<a class="headerlink" href="#is-calculus-required-for-the-cs1-introduction-to-cs-course" title="Permalink to this heading" x-intersect.margin.0%.0%.-70%.0%="activeSection = '#is-calculus-required-for-the-cs1-introduction-to-cs-course'">¶</a></h3>
<p>Typically, calculus is not required for introductory computer science courses, also known as CS1 courses. These courses often focus on the basics of programming and problem-solving using a specific programming language (like Python or Java), and generally don’t involve advanced mathematical concepts.</p>
<p>However, requirements can vary between different universities and programs, and some programs might co-list calculus as a requirement or co-requisite alongside their CS1 course. This is often because calculus is considered part of the foundational curriculum for a degree in computer science, and students are expected to complete it early in their academic career.</p>

<p>An Introduction to Computer Systems course typically focuses on how computers work, from the hardware level up to the interaction with the operating system and software. This can include understanding of computer architecture, memory, processors, I/O devices, and basic operating system principles.</p>
<p>Generally, calculus is not a prerequisite for an introductory course in computer systems. Instead, prerequisites often include an introductory programming course and possibly a course in discrete mathematics or digital logic design. Understanding computer systems usually involves more binary math, logic, and potentially some basic linear algebra, rather than calculus.</p>

<p>Generally, calculus is not required as a prerequisite for a first course in data structures. These courses typically focus on the principles and implementations of various types of data structures like arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs, and the algorithms associated with these data structures. The mathematics involved in understanding these topics is usually discrete mathematics, not calculus.</p>
<p>The prerequisites for a data structures course often include an introductory programming course where students learn the basics of writing, debugging, and testing code. Some universities may also require or recommend a course in discrete mathematics before or alongside the data structures course, as it provides important foundational knowledge for understanding data structures and algorithms.</p>

<p>The sequence and timing of courses can vary quite a bit between different universities and programs, and can also depend on the specific preparation and pace of individual students. However, here’s a general idea of when these courses might typically be taken in a four-year undergraduate Computer Science program:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p><strong>Algorithms</strong>: Typically taken in the second or third year. This course often follows an introductory course in data structures.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Machine Learning</strong>: Usually an upper-level course, so it might be taken in the third or fourth year. It may require prerequisites in algorithms, statistics, or linear algebra.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong>: Also usually an upper-level course, taken in the third or fourth year. It may require prerequisites in algorithms and possibly machine learning.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Computer Graphics</strong>: This could be taken in the second, third, or fourth year, depending on the program and the student’s interests and preparation.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Data Science/Big Data</strong>: These courses may be taken in the second, third, or fourth year, often requiring prerequisites in statistics and possibly algorithms or machine learning.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Computer Vision</strong>: Usually an upper-level course, taken in the third or fourth year. It may require prerequisites in linear algebra, algorithms, and possibly machine learning or computer graphics.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Control Systems or Robotics</strong>: Usually an upper-level course, taken in the third or fourth year. It may require prerequisites in linear algebra, algorithms, and possibly physics.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Signal Processing</strong>: Usually an upper-level course, taken in the third or fourth year. It often requires prerequisites in calculus, linear algebra, and sometimes differential equations.</p></li>

<p>Bloom’s taxonomy is a framework used to classify educational learning objectives into levels of complexity and specificity. The levels are typically listed as:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Remember (Knowledge)</p></li>
<li><p>Understand (Comprehension)</p></li>
<li><p>Apply (Application)</p></li>
<li><p>Analyze (Analysis)</p></li>
<li><p>Evaluate (Evaluation)</p></li>
<li><p>Create (Synthesis)</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Higher numbers to mean that a greater degree of mastery is required in that particular learning outcome for a degree program. However, please note that the actual levels of mastery required can vary greatly depending on the specific curriculum and course requirements of each university’s program. Here’s an illustrative mapping:</p>

<p>The main body that maintains and enforces standards for B.S. programs in Computer Engineering and Electrical Engineering in the United States is ABET (Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology). ABET is a non-profit and non-governmental accrediting agency for programs in applied and natural science, computing, engineering, and engineering technology.</p>
<p>ABET accreditation provides assurance that a college or university program meets the quality standards of the profession for which that program prepares graduates. The accreditation process requires that each program identifies specific learning outcomes and demonstrates that its students have achieved those outcomes.</p>
<p>For Computer Engineering and Electrical Engineering programs specifically, the IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) plays a significant role as a professional organization. While IEEE does not accredit programs, it does contribute to the setting of educational standards in these fields through its Educational Activities Board (EAB), which develops resources and provides support for educators and students.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that in other countries, different organizations may be responsible for maintaining standards in engineering education. For example, in the United Kingdom, the Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET) is one such organization. It’s also common for national or regional accrediting bodies to follow the principles laid out by the International Engineering Alliance’s “Washington Accord,” which outlines the outcomes expected from undergraduate engineering programs.</p>

<h3>What are the key learning outcomes for B.S. programs in Electrical Engineering and Computer Engineering?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-are-the-key-learning-outcomes-for-b-s-programs-in-electrical-engineering-and-computer-engineering" title="Permalink to this heading" x-intersect.margin.0%.0%.-70%.0%="activeSection = '#what-are-the-key-learning-outcomes-for-b-s-programs-in-electrical-engineering-and-computer-engineering'">¶</a></h3>
<p>Here are some of the key learning outcomes that are common for B.S. programs in Electrical Engineering (EE), Computer Engineering (CE), and Computer Science (CS). Note that these outcomes can vary based on the particular focus of a program or institution.</p>
<p><strong>Electrical Engineering (EE):</strong></p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p><strong>Knowledge of Mathematics and Science</strong>: Apply knowledge of mathematics, science, and engineering.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>System Design/Analysis</strong>: Design and conduct experiments, analyze and interpret data, design a system, component, or process to meet desired needs.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Modern Tool Usage</strong>: Use the techniques, skills, and modern engineering tools necessary for engineering practice.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Problem Identification and Solutions</strong>: Identify, formulate, and solve engineering problems.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Professional and Ethical Responsibility</strong>: Understand professional and ethical responsibility.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Communication</strong>: Communicate effectively.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Impact of Engineering Solutions</strong>: Understand the impact of engineering solutions in a global, economic, environmental, and societal context.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Computer Engineering (CE):</strong></p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p><strong>Knowledge of Mathematics and Science</strong>: Apply knowledge of mathematics, science, and engineering.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>System Design/Analysis</strong>: Design and conduct experiments, analyze and interpret data, design a system, component, or process to meet desired needs.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Modern Tool Usage</strong>: Use the techniques, skills, and modern engineering tools necessary for engineering practice.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Problem Identification and Solutions</strong>: Identify, formulate, and solve engineering problems.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Professional and Ethical Responsibility</strong>: Understand professional and ethical responsibility.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Communication</strong>: Communicate effectively.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Impact of Engineering Solutions</strong>: Understand the impact of engineering solutions in a global, economic, environmental, and societal context.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Computer Systems</strong>: Understand computer hardware and software, design computer systems.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Software Design and Development</strong>: Ability to write efficient software, understand software development methodologies.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Common outcomes with Computer Science (CS):</strong></p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p><strong>Problem Solving</strong>: Ability to apply knowledge of computing and mathematics to solve problems.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>System Design/Analysis</strong>: Ability to design, implement and evaluate a computer-based system, process, component, or program to meet desired needs.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Modern Tool Usage</strong>: Use current techniques, skills, and tools necessary for computing practice.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Professional and Ethical Responsibility</strong>: Understand professional, ethical, legal, security and social issues and responsibilities.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Communication</strong>: Ability to communicate effectively with a range of audiences.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Computer Systems</strong>: Understand computer hardware and software, design computer systems (more emphasized in CE than CS).</p></li>
</ol>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that while there are many commonalities between these three fields, each has its own specific areas of focus. For example, electrical engineering places more emphasis on the design and analysis of electrical and electronic systems, while computer engineering straddles the space between electrical engineering and computer science, often focusing more on the hardware and low-level software aspects of computing. On the other hand, computer science usually places more emphasis on algorithm design, data structures, and high-level software design and development.</p>
