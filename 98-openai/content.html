<h2>When was the first computer science program created?<a class="headerlink" href="#when-was-the-first-computer-science-program-created" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>The first computer science program can be traced back to 1962, when Purdue University established the first Department of Computer Science in the United States. At that time, computer science was a relatively new field, and many universities had only offered computer-related courses as part of their mathematics or engineering programs.</p>
<p>As interest in computer science grew, more universities began to create dedicated computer science programs. By the late 1960s and early 1970s, many universities around the world had established computer science departments and degree programs. The development of these programs was further supported by organizations like the ACM and the IEEE Computer Society, which provided curriculum recommendations and guidelines to help standardize computer science education.</p>

<h2>When were the first curricular guidelines for computer science degrees established?<a class="headerlink" href="#when-were-the-first-curricular-guidelines-for-computer-science-degrees-established" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>The first curricular guidelines for computer science degrees were published in 1968 by the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM). The report, titled “Curriculum 68: Recommendations for Academic Programs in Computer Science,” provided a framework for institutions to develop undergraduate computer science programs.</p>
<p>“Curriculum 68” aimed to define the core components of a computer science education and offer guidance on organizing courses and content. It was a landmark document that helped shape the early development of computer science as an academic discipline. Since then, the ACM has periodically updated its curriculum recommendations to keep pace with the rapidly evolving field of computer science.</p>

<section id="which-of-the-curricla-reference-cs1-and-cs2-is-this-terminology-still-relevant">
<h2>Which of the curricla reference CS1 and CS2. Is this terminology still relevant?<a class="headerlink" href="#which-of-the-curricla-reference-cs1-and-cs2-is-this-terminology-still-relevant" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>CS1 and CS2 terminology originated from the early ACM curricular guidelines and has been used in subsequent versions to some extent. The terms refer to the foundational sequence of computer science courses, where CS1 is an introductory course in programming, and CS2 is a course that focuses on data structures and more advanced programming concepts. Here’s a brief overview of the curricular guidelines that mention CS1 and CS2:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Curriculum 68 (1968): Does not specifically use the terms CS1 and CS2.</p></li>
<li><p>Curriculum 78 (1978): Refers to the terms CS1 and CS2.</p></li>
<li><p>Computing Curricula 1991 (CC1991): Uses the terms CS1 and CS2.</p></li>
<li><p>Computing Curricula 2001 (CC2001): Refers to CS1 and CS2 in the context of introductory courses, but with less emphasis.</p></li>
<li><p>Computing Curricula 2005 (CC2005): Does not explicitly use the terms CS1 and CS2.</p></li>
<li><p>Computer Science Curricula 2013 (CS2013): Refers to CS1 and CS2 in the context of introductory courses, but with less emphasis.</p></li>
<li><p>Computing Curricula 2020 (CC2020): Does not explicitly use the terms CS1 and CS2.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>While the terminology of CS1 and CS2 might not be explicitly mentioned in the most recent curricular guidelines (CC2020), the concepts behind them are still relevant. The CC2020 guidelines provide learning outcomes and topics for introductory programming courses (similar to CS1 and CS2) under the “Algorithms and Complexity” and “Programming Languages” knowledge areas.</p>
<p>In summary, the terms CS1 and CS2 might not be explicitly used in the latest ACM/IEEE curricular guidelines, but the concepts behind these foundational computer science courses remain relevant and are covered within the broader framework of the guidelines.</p>

<h2>How about Cybersecurity?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-about-cybersecurity" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>For Cybersecurity, the mathematical requirements may not be as extensive as those for a computer science degree. However, having a strong foundation in certain mathematical areas is crucial for understanding and applying cybersecurity concepts. The Joint Task Force on Cybersecurity Education, formed by ACM, IEEE-CS, AIS, and IFIP, released the Cybersecurity Curricular Guidelines in 2017 (CSEC2017). According to the CSEC2017 guidelines, cybersecurity students should have a solid foundation in the following mathematical areas:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><em>Discrete Mathematics</em>: As with other computing disciplines, discrete mathematics is essential for understanding fundamental concepts such as logic, set theory, relations, functions, combinatorics, graph theory, and proofs.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Probability and Statistics</em>: This area is important for risk assessment, anomaly detection, and understanding the performance of security systems. Students should learn basic probability theory, random variables, distributions, hypothesis testing, and regression analysis.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Basic Algebra, Number Theory, and Finite Fields</em>: These topics are particularly relevant for cryptography, which is a crucial aspect of cybersecurity. Students should understand concepts such as modular arithmetic, prime numbers, and finite fields.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Calculus</em>: A basic understanding of differential and integral calculus may be useful in some areas of cybersecurity, such as optimization and analysis of algorithms. However, the emphasis on calculus in a cybersecurity program might not be as strong as in a computer science program.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>While the exact courses and extent of mathematical knowledge required for a cybersecurity degree may vary depending on the institution and the specific program, the above topics represent the core mathematical areas that the CSEC2017 curricular guidelines recommend for a well-rounded cybersecurity education.</p>

<h2>Ok, but what are the top six, since most majors can only be 6 courses?<a class="headerlink" href="#ok-but-what-are-the-top-six-since-most-majors-can-only-be-6-courses" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>If you need to choose only six courses for a minor in computer science, I would recommend focusing on the most fundamental and broadly applicable topics. Here are the top six courses to consider:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><em>Introduction to Programming (CS1)</em>: This foundational course teaches the basics of programming, usually using a language like Python, Java, or C++. It focuses on problem-solving, algorithmic thinking, and basic programming constructs.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Data Structures and Algorithms (CS2)</em>: This course builds upon the programming skills acquired in CS1 and covers essential data structures (e.g., arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs) and algorithms (e.g., searching, sorting). It also introduces algorithm analysis and complexity.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Discrete Mathematics</em>: This course covers the fundamentals of discrete math, including set theory, logic, relations, functions, combinatorics, and graph theory, which are essential for understanding computer science concepts and algorithms.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Computer Organization and Architecture</em>: This course provides an understanding of the basics of digital logic, memory systems, processor design, and computer organization, which are important for understanding how computers work at the hardware level.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Operating Systems</em>: This course introduces the fundamentals of operating system design, process management, memory management, and file systems, which are necessary for understanding the software that manages computer hardware.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Databases, Networking, or Web/Mobile Development</em>: For the sixth course, consider choosing one that aligns with your interests and career goals. Databases will provide essential skills for managing and working with data, Networking will give you an understanding of computer communication, and Web/Mobile Development will teach you practical skills for developing software applications.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These six courses provide a solid foundation in computer science, covering essential topics that are broadly applicable across various computing disciplines. It’s important to note that the specific courses offered and their sequence may differ among institutions, so consult the course catalog of the institution you’re interested in for more accurate information.</p>
