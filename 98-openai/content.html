<h2>When was the first computer science program created?<a class="headerlink" href="#when-was-the-first-computer-science-program-created" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The first computer science program can be traced back to 1962, when Purdue University established the first Department of Computer Science in the United States. At that time, computer science was a relatively new field, and many universities had only offered computer-related courses as part of their mathematics or engineering programs.</p>
<p>As interest in computer science grew, more universities began to create dedicated computer science programs. By the late 1960s and early 1970s, many universities around the world had established computer science departments and degree programs. The development of these programs was further supported by organizations like the ACM and the IEEE Computer Society, which provided curriculum recommendations and guidelines to help standardize computer science education.</p>

<h2>When were the first curricular guidelines for computer science degrees established?<a class="headerlink" href="#when-were-the-first-curricular-guidelines-for-computer-science-degrees-established" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The first curricular guidelines for computer science degrees were published in 1968 by the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM). The report, titled “Curriculum 68: Recommendations for Academic Programs in Computer Science,” provided a framework for institutions to develop undergraduate computer science programs.</p>
<p>“Curriculum 68” aimed to define the core components of a computer science education and offer guidance on organizing courses and content. It was a landmark document that helped shape the early development of computer science as an academic discipline. Since then, the ACM has periodically updated its curriculum recommendations to keep pace with the rapidly evolving field of computer science.</p>

<section id="which-of-the-curricla-reference-cs1-and-cs2-is-this-terminology-still-relevant">
<h2>Which of the curricla reference CS1 and CS2. Is this terminology still relevant?<a class="headerlink" href="#which-of-the-curricla-reference-cs1-and-cs2-is-this-terminology-still-relevant" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>CS1 and CS2 terminology originated from the early ACM curricular guidelines and has been used in subsequent versions to some extent. The terms refer to the foundational sequence of computer science courses, where CS1 is an introductory course in programming, and CS2 is a course that focuses on data structures and more advanced programming concepts. Here’s a brief overview of the curricular guidelines that mention CS1 and CS2:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Curriculum 68 (1968): Does not specifically use the terms CS1 and CS2.</p></li>
<li><p>Curriculum 78 (1978): Refers to the terms CS1 and CS2.</p></li>
<li><p>Computing Curricula 1991 (CC1991): Uses the terms CS1 and CS2.</p></li>
<li><p>Computing Curricula 2001 (CC2001): Refers to CS1 and CS2 in the context of introductory courses, but with less emphasis.</p></li>
<li><p>Computing Curricula 2005 (CC2005): Does not explicitly use the terms CS1 and CS2.</p></li>
<li><p>Computer Science Curricula 2013 (CS2013): Refers to CS1 and CS2 in the context of introductory courses, but with less emphasis.</p></li>
<li><p>Computing Curricula 2020 (CC2020): Does not explicitly use the terms CS1 and CS2.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>While the terminology of CS1 and CS2 might not be explicitly mentioned in the most recent curricular guidelines (CC2020), the concepts behind them are still relevant. The CC2020 guidelines provide learning outcomes and topics for introductory programming courses (similar to CS1 and CS2) under the “Algorithms and Complexity” and “Programming Languages” knowledge areas.</p>
<p>In summary, the terms CS1 and CS2 might not be explicitly used in the latest ACM/IEEE curricular guidelines, but the concepts behind these foundational computer science courses remain relevant and are covered within the broader framework of the guidelines.</p>
